								One out of every three cups of coffee consumed globally is linked to Brazil, the
								world's
								largest coffee exporter. Among the top five coffee-producing countries —Brazil,
								Vietnam,
								Colombia, Indonesia, and Ethiopia— each brings unique qualities to the global coffee
								market. Brazil, for instance, exports about 90% high-quality Arabica beans, a staple
								in
								premium espresso blends. Similarly, Vietnam leads in robusta production, while
								Colombia
								is renowned for its smooth, balanced Arabica. Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee,
								offers
								rich, diverse flavors, and Indonesia is famed for specialty coffees like Sumatra and
								Java.
								<br>
								While all these nations have the capacity to export roasted, value-added coffee,
								green
								coffee beans still dominate exports. Expanding processed coffee exports across these
								leading producers could provide consumers with greater access to their unique
								flavors
								and promote value addition within producing countries.
								<br>
								Each country also boasts diverse coffee-growing regions, varying in altitude,
								varieties,
								and cultivation systems. For example, Brazil's regions range from high-altitude,
								handpicked farms to mechanized flatlands. In contrast, Ethiopia's coffee often grows
								wild or semi-wild under forest canopies, while Colombia's coffee thrives on steep
								Andean
								slopes.
								<br>
								Supporting the processed coffee industries in these countries offers global
								consumers
								not only enhanced flavor options but also a way to empower millions of smallholder
								coffee producers whose livelihoods depend on the crop.

							<p>
								The history of coffee cultivation in Vietnam dates back to the late 19th century,
								during the
								French colonial period. Coffee was introduced by the French in the 1850s, initially
								in the
								central highlands region, which offered ideal growing conditions. By the early 20th
								century,
								the Vietnamese coffee industry began to take root, with the country slowly becoming
								one of
								the largest coffee producers in the world. In the 1980s, after the Vietnam War and
								during
								the process of economic reforms known as Đổi Mới, coffee production saw significant
								growth,
								particularly in the robusta sector.
								<br>
								Today, Vietnam ranks as the second-largest coffee producer globally, following
								Brazil. The
								majority of Vietnam's coffee production is robusta, which is known for its strong,
								bitter
								taste and higher caffeine content. While arabica coffee is also grown in some
								regions,
								robusta dominates the industry, especially in the highlands of Dak Lak, Lam Dong,
								and Gia
								Lai provinces. Vietnam's coffee is generally characterized by its strong, bold
								flavors with
								earthy and nutty undertones.
								<br>
								Vietnamese coffee is highly valued for its consistency and robust production scale,
								but the
								quality can vary. The quality of the beans is affected by factors like altitude,
								climate,
								and farming practices. The country has made strides in improving the quality of its
								beans,
								particularly arabica, as more farmers adopt sustainable farming practices and refine
								their
								processing methods. Vietnamese coffee has a reputation for being robust and
								functional in
								blends, and the country's coffee culture, especially the iconic “cà phê sữa đá”
								(iced coffee
								with condensed milk), has gained international recognition. However, there is a
								growing
								focus on quality production, with some specialty coffees now coming from more
								selective,
								high-altitude farms. These efforts are helping elevate the global perception of
								Vietnamese
								coffee, making it a noteworthy player in the specialty coffee market.
